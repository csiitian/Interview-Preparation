## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Maven or Gradle (for building projects)
- Basic understanding of object-oriented programming
- Familiarity with design patterns

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/low-level-system-design.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```
   cd low-level-system-design
   ```
3. Build the project (if applicable)
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Study Path

### 1. Design Patterns
Start with understanding the fundamental design patterns:
1. Study the [Creational Patterns](patterns/creational/)
2. Move on to [Structural Patterns](patterns/structural/)
3. Finally, explore [Behavioral Patterns](patterns/behavioral/)

### 2. SOLID Principles
Understand the SOLID principles to write better code:
1. Study each principle in the [SOLID Principles](solid_principles/) directory
2. Implement examples for each principle
3. Identify violations in existing code

### 3. Design Problems
Practice solving design problems:
1. Start with simpler problems like [Parking Lot](design_problems/parking_lot/) or [Tic Tac Toe](design_problems/tic_tac_toe/)
2. Move to medium complexity problems like [Library Management](design_problems/library_management/) or [Vending Machine](design_problems/vending_machine/)
3. Finally, tackle complex problems like [Stock Exchange System](design_problems/stock_exchange_system/) or [Social Networking Service](design_problems/social_networking_service/)

### 4. Concurrency
Learn about concurrent programming:
1. Study [Thread Management](concurrency/)
2. Understand [Synchronization](concurrency/)
3. Learn about [Deadlock Prevention](concurrency/)
4. Explore [Thread Pool](concurrency/) implementation
