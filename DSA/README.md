### Have you ever wondered where can you find all the resources for mastering DSA ?

Yes, and your senior said only one sentence: "GFG and Leetcode are enough !"

That's correct, there is no need for wondering here and there. I am providing all the resources
obviously you should be good at reading and writing. I don't care if you write in your laptop or on paper.

If you find any topic difficult then go to your favorite youtuber, I will mention some of them ( I am not in that category )

I just read somewhere on leetcode where a Great Programmer 
( I think he was holding Guardian Badge on leetcode ) 
said that I run my program in my mind.

I mean really ? yes, that's possible 
I also believe in `Power of Imagination`.

So If you want to become more than average programmer 
just practice more and more. 
But if you really want to be Great Programmer 
then use `Power Of Imagination`, 
try to find patterns and write code in your mind and run code in your mind.
```

I think that's all guys !!!

I hope you become a Great Programmer one day !

And also along with your learning journey, try to share your learning with others on any Platforms, Twitter, Medium or Leetcode.
So that others can really benefit from that.

Now once you read the chapters, also make sure to practice questions on that topics.
So let's pick one topic `Stack` now go to leetcode, select `Stack` tagged questions and select difficulty as easy.
Yes, we are going to solve `Easy` questions first and now sort it based on `Acceptance Rate`.
The more `Acceptance Rate` means the question has been solved by many peoples successfully who have tried it.

https://leetcode.com/problemset/?topicSlugs=stack&page=1&difficulty=EASY&sorting=W3sic29ydE9yZGVyIjoiREVTQ0VORElORyIsIm9yZGVyQnkiOiJBQ19SQVRFIn1d

So after that my url looks like that. Now pick one by one question and start to solve them.

#### What if you are not able to solve that questions ?
Well, in that case don't worry. This will happen initially for most of the times and later also will happend but you will get habitual.

So now go the `Solutions` tab. where you can find solutions with explanations.

![img.png](img.png)

Read them and if you don't understand just comment your query, `Author` or any other people might respond. and try to see more and more solutions till you are not satisfied.

And this approach you need to repeat, that's it.

And you are good for the Interview. ( Because that's the ultimate `GOAL` )
